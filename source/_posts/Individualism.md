excerpt: "Is the General philosophy of people dominated by a 'Me, Myself & I' approach to life, and How should we think about the dynamic between the individual & higher societal structures?"
---

The dispute between the individualist paradigm, which puts the individual at the nucleus of deriving all philosophies & moralities,

contrasted by a more collectivist approach, that puts “society”, or broadly speaking, a dimension higher than the individual, as the nucleus,

is one big philosophical dispute among the laity & philosophers alike.

But how should we think about the spectrum of those two worldviews that tap into our everyday lives & life philosophy?

And do they actually go in opposition, in the first place?

### The individualist paradigm:

The biggest arguments that are usually purported for the individualistic worldview, 
is that individualistic self-interest, will, by necessity, eventually end up being beneficial to society.

The person who’s trying to sell bread for some cash, even if completely self-interested, will actually end up serving a broader societal scheme, that will contribute to both the self-interested seller and the buyer.

Ayn Rand was one of biggest proponents of those arguments for individualism, and how it’s perfectly compatible with the broader health of a society.

it’s important to clarify before we move on that, In many cases, the collectivist-leaning won’t disagree with the individualists on every decision or matter, 

But in situations where there might be a conflict of interest between the individual and the broader collective structure, which is not really always the case.

So the individualists & the collectivists won’t disagree on the necessity of preserving basic individuals needs, to keep the structure of society intact, (though they might differ on the methods of doing that),

but they might differ on the morality of distributing money to the less fortunate/wealthy, for instance.


### Transcending the dichotomies:

Okay, so instead of regurgitating a clear-cut one-side inclination or the other, let’s do our own version and think about this properly.

Both the individual and the collective are extremely important in so many ways.

See this is the problem with such dichotomies, 

people will think that arguing for individualism or collectivism assumes one is more important than the other,

but that isn’t always the case, if we actually lay out our assumptions properly.

It’s just a matter of <b>emphasizing</b> the right one, in the right context ,<b>based on human inclinations and nature;</b>
Let me explain:

So I’ll never tell a person to not forget to eat food, as <b>important</b> as that is,

because the emphasis there is not needed, based on our human nature to incline towards it regardless.

Same with these discussions, 

the first step is to acknowledge that both are extremely important, and conceptualize that we’re discussing the emphasis really,

as in this discussion, trying to argue which one is more important,  will only lead to confusion & lack of understanding, which is a path many people choose to confusingly take.

and as Iain mcgilchrist says: “an explanation that will take you only some of the way, is only a liability.”

So this is a very important assumption not to be missed, as we’re going.

And in any case, we assume that both the collective and the individual are equally important by setting legal systems, and setting the institution of law, in action.

So, a fundamental assumption of law is that certain individuals’ “interests” (i.e. criminals) should be constrained, for the benefit of the collective.

The same could be applied & reversed, when the individuals’ needs are put above, sometimes, a possibly hegemonic collective, through constitutions, for instance.

So this kind of backs our point that both of them are equally important, and anyone who tries to argue for the importance of one over the other, is missing the deep aspects of this discussion.

Now, the question remains, which one should we really emphasize more, based on all the complex variables of humans and their psychology, at hand?

Ok, so it seems like our inclination is a selfish one, and we can’t help but to be selfish, and also relatively self-centered,

It’s built into the structure of our psychology and perception in a sense.

We perceive the world with ourselves as individuals being main & predominant in that perceptual apparatus, from all different angles.

So that leaves us to say that the individual is more or less naturally inclined to be that, <b>especially also, given the context of today,</b>

which puts that individualism <b>on steroids</b>, in a sense.

An example of that individualism on steroids is the phenomena in Science known as the Replication Crisis.

This phenomena occurs when a scientist, or group of scientists (especially in what’s known as the social sciences) are researching a specific topic, 

but they end up not being sincere about the results,
or faking a certain, maybe, “more” exciting results, 

Because of a short-term self-interest of getting published in certain papers, or getting certain recognition/attention, 

all of that, at the expense of accurate results, which would really benefit society & the collective, more than otherwise.

The name of this phenomena is derived from the idea that those insincere results will simply not replicate, if the study is to be conducted again, 

because the results were simply not accurate, and were fully or partially forged.

Now we’re not saying that every self-interested person will end up doing that, obviously, self-interest in itself can definitely be a virtue,

but the emphasis on it, in light of our self-centered perception which is already omni-present, might indeed make such things more likely, or in another word, overemphasize it.

And the emphasis on the collective would’ve probably balanced things in the right direction, rather than blow that individualism out of proportion.

Therefore in light of this observation, 

sometimes bringing up the broader structure of society into our perceptions more, 
might be indeed useful, to kind of balance that natural inclination of sheer self-interest, which is, again, obviously a healthy thing to have in the company of a balanced concern for the collective, for the reasons we explicated.

There’s something to be said with how this shouldn’t be misunderstood to be applied to the economic system. 

This, at the most basic level, is trying to anthropologically, and psychologically analyze how we tend to perceive the structure we are embedded in, and doesn’t necessarily apply to the economics of things, as that is a relatively separate discussion in a sense.


But now, the individualist might come back and say: 
“Hey, what about the point I mentioned in the beginning about being self-centered/individualistic, necessarily benefiting society anyways?Shouldn’t we just take our own individualistic inclinations to be valid, if they benefit society in any case?”
That’s a valid objection, but the assumption that the totality of self-centered actions, necessarily benefits the broader structure is only partially true, as we have also partially shown in the example of the replication crisis.

But anyways, let’s tackle this objection directly, 

the self-interested individual can indeed be beneficial to the collective when the market is grossly involved,

but that benefit doesn’t <b>necessarily</b> hold up in forces where the market is not a <b>primary</b> driver.

Take fertility rates as another example to make our point concrete to our individualist counter-arguer.

The individual being self-centered and wanting to willfully not have kids can be perceived as an individualistic self-interested choice, 

but that “individual” choice if scaled enough can have catastrophic and existential consequences to a specific geographical place/society like South Korea, currently, which is having severe problems with fertility rates and building a society for tomorrow (it’s also a global issue).

And so an emphasis to the societal aspect & importance of fertility, might’ve been a driver to counteract fertility issues, rather than an alternative perspective.

Obviously, there’re other reasons for decrease in fertility, but this is only a tangential discussion to our point.

So the mere self-interest that necessarily benefits other people and society is a function of the market, and will not necessarily hold up in relatively extra-market contexts, like the example above.

And the market is obviously an expanding and relatively ill-defined ecosystem, but that doesn’t mean it’s present in all aspects of life, all the time.



### Conclusion:

So now that we laid out the arguments, we see that the malignancy in the title, is really one of over-emphasizing the self.

We live in a me, myself, & I age, which is fine, and not necessarily harmful in essence, as we explicated above, 

but that should be balanced, and nested within a hierarchy of structures above it like the family or more broadly society.

We do it in any case for some practical reasons, as the example of the law we gave, 

but we might as well incorporate it in our conscious perception & life philosophy to take things to the next beneficial level.
