excerpt: "Knocking out some false principles on the nature of identity, and how one should convey themselves in the world... "
---

Yes… I mean this title completely, but hear me out, it’s not as crazy as it sounds.

There are many different conceptions or ideas circulating around,  especially in recent times,

that convey this idea that “people should accept as you are”, 

or from another angle, 
“identity shouldn’t be boxed”.

And some other instantiations of this concept, include the phrase:

“just be yourself and don’t care about what people say.”

Now, just like everything else, there are parts of those statements that could be true in some contexts,

but as a general rule to have, 
I would go as far as to say they’re possible prescriptions for narcissism.
<br>

And we can see this reality vividly,

when we specifically unpack why both the statements that:

1) “identity shouldn’t be limited”

& 

2) “you shouldn’t care about what others say”

are indeed non-optimal to abide by, to put it lightly.

And those two statement are really consequences of each other, in some deep way,

because most people who claim abiding by one of the statements, will mostly adopt the other, as a consequence.


### 1) Why identity needs to be limited (rigidity-fluidity axis):

A common theme that people claim to be optimal, is that identity needs to transcend being “boxed” or “limited”, because humans are complex, etc.

But with deep introspection and thought,
that “box” or limit to identity,

is actually necessary to have any kind of functional or cohesive relationship between humans.

Because when you limit that identity, you’re boxing both the <b>good</b> and the bad attributes (we’ll talk about the bad attributes in a sec).

So… 
You don’t trust a person because they “don’t” have an identity and they’re not in a “box”, and they’re fluidly complex, 

you trust someone because you know they’ll still contain the building blocks of trust in their identity, even tomorrow, and next week.

You don’t have to exhaust their identity to its core, but you know that there are certain lines that their “identity” won’t cross.

That’s what trust is.

If identity was without limits, that privilege of deep human connection wouldn’t be conceivable.

And so, as soon as you say there’s no need for that “box”, your also implicitly excluding “boxing” all the good attributes,

then, that means you discard all the distinguishing factors of being a “good” human, or having good character,

which obviously contains all the characteristics for building relationships, in the first place, even with oneself, btw.

And clearly, all relationships are built upon the fact that the person I met is going to have, relatively speaking, the same “good” attributes.

There’s also something to be said for “changing” something to the better in the first place, and how that necessitates a “box” to identity.

You can’t “change” from one state to another, or you can’t “improve”, without a box that you start with, 

the idea of change, in and of itself, assumes a box or a focal point, to start with.

So the position is actually an unattainable one, anyways,

since humans can’t help but to change their characters with feedback and interactions with the world, 

which itself assumes the existence of some kind of box, to begin with. 

So now that we established that a limit is actually necessary, the next question that asks itself, is what should be the nature of that box?

We can start off by saying that this “box” needs to be one that is open enough to asymptotically shoot off the bad attributes, or the bad aspects of identity,

but has to be closed enough to retain and improve the good aspects of identity or the self.

And this balance can’t be struck without acknowledging the necessity of a limit or a box.

The claim that we criticised above, 
essentially focuses on the bad attributes needing to be shot off, 

and so they claim that “we don’t need a limit”,

but that claim doesn’t focus or account for  the fact that, just as we need to be open & fluid enough to expel the bad attributes, 

we also need to be closed enough, to retain and improve the good attributes in identity, which obviously requires a hypothetical “box”.

<br><br>
You can finally think of this first part,

as establishing and exploring the X-axis of identity, and where to situate oneself in that axis/spectrum,

so let’s call this axis, the fluid-rigid axis:

<img src="/img/xaxis.jpg”>

Now in the next exploration/section we’ll establish the Y-axis of identity, and recapitulate it with its sibling, the rigid-fluid axis, discussed above.


### 2) Why Identity needs to be criticized & guided (internal-external axis):

A main principle to the identity of a sane human, is that identity should always be negotiated.

But wait?

isn’t it the case that our identities are internal, and very much private, 

and are not really open systems in the strict sense of the word?

well, not particularly, 

because we convey ourselves in the world many times, 

and get hit with a reality we didn’t account for,  

or people call us out on something, and we have, or at least should have, a degree of shift and adjustment to that identity, whatever that includes.

Obviously, this, generally becomes less and less the case with age, increased wisdom, developed consciousness, and life experience.

This also, regardless of age, 
more or less applies to different people differently, depending on variations on complex environmental and psychological traits.

Now, having laid this foundation which probably seems intuitive to many, but acts as a good reminder, 

there’s also a difficult balance to get right in this dynamic of,

identity changing 

VS

sticking to your grounds up against feedback & even more broadly, input from the world.

Because if you open it up <b>too much</b> to the forces of the outside world & feedback, 

then it contradicts the whole definition of an identity,

which is a notion that should fundamentally, <b>at least to some degree</b>, be consistent across space and time (as we gave reasons why that should be the case, in the section above),

and obviously this wouldn’t be a plausible or an optimal state to be in.

and this possible pitfall of taking too much feedback, 

is what the “people should accept you as you’re” folks, <b>overcorrect</b> for in their approach.

Because the idea of “accept me as I am” is that one comes through with an identity, that effectively shuts off feedback,

Which is problematic because one, as we aforementioned, has to open up their identity for feedback, to a certain extent,

though, to strike the right balance, one has to be equipped with the right navigation system of balancing that feedback,

rather than taking everything in, and being a completely open system.

And the difficult balance & getting it right, could really be summarised in the word negotiation, which is used very precisely & accurately here, 

the reason being that negotiation is striking the right balance, 

in the sense that a fundamental nature of its definition is that it’s not giving too much, 

but it’s also not taking too much, and this in a deep way applies to identity, and how it should be approached & balanced.

Now how would this constitute our Y-axis?We can think of this domain or section as constituting the Internal-external axis (Y-axis):

### Recapping the 2 axises:

So now that we have laid the X & the Y axis separately,

I think it’s useful to see a graph example on different variations, in our new completed graph of identity:

<img src="/img/xyaxis.jpg” >


### Some Limitations on the model:

There’s something to be said with how limited the model in describing things very precisely,

Because if we think about it holistically, 

the internal and the external are overlapping and they affect each other in complex ways that are hardly even separable, 

but there’s also usefulness and separating them a separation of emphasis, with full awareness that the internal states of humans are very much affected by the external, and vice versa.

### The internet:

The internet has created a condensed, hyper-version of the false principle of “accept as I am”, 

which is also a pressing reason why all the reminders of identity we discussed, 
are actually even more relevant in today’s world, compared to any other time.

Because within the confines of the internet, you can essentially find a support for any type of character or identity trait, good or bad, 

which adds an invigoration of this principle for someone that espouses it as an idea, even more than if the internet didn’t exist.

If we contrast the days of old, and the age of the internet,

we see that if you go with this principle of “accept as I am” to people around you in, say the year 1300, 

they’ll quickly dismiss your principle, since obviously those people will disagree with how you convey parts of “yourself”,

however, in the age of the internet, since you have access to the whole world, you can basically find whoever confirms your “self as it’s”, and you can bask in your “self as it’s” image.

Because if you can create or essentially join an echo-chamber or more bluntly, get unconditional support, for every possible type of character, including bad parts of that identity or character,

then it seems that it will only increase belief and immersion in that false principle.

So no matter how bad of an idea or trait one can possess, 

which might be a trait that you need to be called out for,

You can essentially go on reddit,  find you a community, and have all the people with the same trait knocking on your door, and pushing it forward as ok, etc… 
(seriously folks, search for r/askTrans on Reddit, and see for yourself).

And approval, by the way, doesn’t need to be explicit, it could be in the form of attention and mere engagement…


### Conclusion:

I’ll end this by saying that it’s not really necessarily the case that all of what we said can be detected easily.

There is something to be said on how implicit and subtle many of the false principles we mentioned can sneak themselves into a person’s perception.

Sometimes constraining themselves into specific domains like careers, or relationships, 

or even restricting themselves into applying to 1 person,

and sometimes being as broad as applying to all aspects of life,

and so detection of those fallacious principle can many times be subtle and contextual even,

and indeed requires deep introspection and self-awareness.
