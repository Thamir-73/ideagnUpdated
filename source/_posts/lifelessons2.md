excerpt: "Some concise life lessons & observations I've written down in a semi-poetic way.. "
---

Those are some of the “lessons” & “observations” that I wrote down as I think through life.

I love to do it this way because it challenges me to put my thoughts in a relatively succinct way, and I also force myself to make it have a poetic aspect in some sense (at least poetic at my level), which gives the information outside of the insights themselves, even more of a flavor.
<br><br>

I want to reflect a bit on why I used “lessons” & “observations”, in this piece.
<br>
I think grouping “rules/lessons” & “observations” together is a great mix, because rules are things that can be interpreted in a limited way, because it’s a blunt way or advice to myself and the reader to really engage in something specific,

while observations could be interpreted by the person reading in many different ways, and I love this discrepancy between the two and I think it could be complimentary in many interesting ways:
<br>
<hr>
* It’s better to start to fail, than fail to start.
<hr>

* Thamir’s razor:The outcome where you have to painfully swallow your pride, is the best outcome, and the least outcome you’ll regret.
<hr>

* Just as following the status-quo position, *automatically*, is incorrect, going against the status quo position *automatically* is also incorrect.Status quo-ers have a false negative vision, and they think there’s no intellectual nail they can strike on their own.anti-status quo-ers have a false positive vision, and they think they can strike every intellectual nail on their own,Both of them are incorrect.Navigate those things logically & professionally and think outside of those pressures, sometimes the group/“herd” is more correct than you’d ever be, & many other times it isn’t.
<hr>

* Emphasis on already known things, is sometimes more important than new information, per se.Never underestimate or devalue the importance of people “repeating” things that “everybody” knows,knowing & emphasising are two different things.
<hr>

* The biggest mystery about expression is that when you’re explaining something to someone else, you’re also explaining it to yourself, as much as you’re explaining it to the other person. 
<hr>

* Before you ask a question, reflect if you’re actually asking it to genuinely hear an answer, or for other petty ego-related human reasons, I promise you, it happens more often than you think.
<hr>

* The only mistake that’s not worth making is quitting.
<hr>

* Arrogance is a sneaky vice that could coexist contextually with many good attributes. Never stop consciously hunting for it in your own heart.Someone can be intelligent, knowledgable, kind, & generous, but still has pride, arrogance & ego ingrained in their psyche.
<hr>

* Don’t fall for the subconscious trap of thinking the amount of work & effort you put in a project should give you the entitlement for people’s attention. That way, you’ll lose the other valuable things/lessons you can extract other than attention,& you’ll also most likely quit prematurely on almost everything.
<hr>

* Everytime you’re frustrated from a mistake you made in the present, think about how much of a miracle it’s that you can infinitely improve into the future.
<hr>

* Empathy is a consequence of self-awareness, and not intelligence or any other attribute.
<hr>

* The biggest delusion people have is thinking they can reach the horizons of their thought process on their own. 
<hr>

* Language is not only expressive, it’s also simultaneously mind-expansive.
<hr>

* Competency & Jealousy are inversely correlated.
<hr>

* Never underestimate your capacity for jealousy or envy, because it’s there, and could sneak itself into your so called cold “rationality & reason”.
<hr>

* An Exception can be the sole enemy of habits. The only objective needed in building a habit is to ask yourself: how do I not fool myself into making a so called “important” exception, today?
<hr>

* We built all these technologies to make things “easy/comfortable”, then “easy” became the new hard on the human psychology…
<hr>

* The collapse of the sacred into the profane, collapsed the moral into the temperamental.
