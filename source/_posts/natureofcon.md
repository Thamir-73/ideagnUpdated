excerpt: "On the Nature of Reality: An exploration on how limits paradoxically make up most unbounded progress in all domains."
---

I’ve been thinking about the nature of logic، reality، our cognition, and how the world works.

(Yeah I know this too much to put in 1 blog post, but hear me out…),

Especially in light of reading iain mcgillchrist’s book, The Master and His Emmisiary, which is a book that explores the fundamental, and almost <b>irreconcilable</b> differences between the left & right hemispheres of human brains, even though they exist within the same entity/human (will elaborate later)…

And that book is definitely one that kind of revolutionized parts of my thinking.

See, I always detect those paradoxes that I’ve just been marvelled on how they really seem to coexist in the world, at the same time.

And that book has really invigorated me to think about this even more.

So I’ll try to explore a few of those “paradoxes” (or maybe you can help me unpack them as non-paradoxes) or examples, 

and hopefully we can explore some insights out of those examples, 

and maybe the insights are really embedded in the examples themselves, in some deep way, after all.

### Uniqueness is Imitation:

Take the example of how to be unique, & express our “uniqueness”, 
we need a certain kind of identicality, 
and perhaps even copying of each other.

If you don’t really consider this to be accurate at the first instance, 

This might become more obvious when you contemplate & imagine secluding a person entirely from childhood; 

that would definitely not make them more unique, in the way we really conceptualize uniqueness,

or to put it more precisely, 

they wouldn’t be able to express their uniqueness or unique perspectives to others (or even to themselves in some deep way), which is itself a prerequisite for what we would call “unique”.

The social coming together that happens between humans, and all the imitation that comes with it, is a (paradoxically enough) self-exploratory process, really more than any solitary endeavour, 

including the exploration of all the deep “unique” aspects of ourselves & our psyche.

And despite this copying of each other, 
that’s needed to be unique, 

there’s also (perhaps more obviously), at the same time,

a certain kind of intellectual seclusion, that’s needed, in conjunction with that copying,

for the “uniqueness” to manifest itself.

and it’s very interesting to think about this seemingly possible contradiction, which seems irreconcilable, 

but manifests itself all the time, 
<b>whether one is aware of it or not. </b>

### The brain and the thin line it walks:

Another interesting example that is specific to the book is how the brain has fundamentally colluding paradigms between the two hemispheres (right & left),

and they both need to be there, despite their possible almost irreconcilability, for the human to function the way they’re.

The investigation of the book goes to contrast how the left-hemisphere of the brain 
is less contextual, more fragmentary (tending to separate entities, than look at things as wholes or in their full context), more mechanical, and is more tunnel-visioned, so to speak,

while the “master”, 
the right hemisphere, 

is so contextual and tries to be holistic in every way it can, including seeing its own limitations,

and they both inhibit & modulate each other, in very complex ways, constantly.

And those two seem irreconcilable, at the first instance, to be in a single worldview (or in a single skull for that matter),

but in a weird complex way, 
their amalgamation and constant “battle”, for lack of a better word, is what makes the human race as complexly intelligent & unique as it is, 

and it wouldn’t have been that way, 
in any other possible way.

and this necessity for both of those “contradictory” paradigms becomes more clear, if you actually look into the real world.

There’s a necessity to be tunnel visioned, because if we were so open & holistic all the time, action would almost be impossible, because action is more or less by definition, fragmentary, omissive, and requires separation of entities & things in the world. 

But too much of a tunnel-vision leaves us less self-conscious, and with less space to challenge our existing paradigms, which affects, again, how we see the world, which in turn also ends up affecting our actions.

So to say the brain “walks a thin-line” is selling it too shortly, 

because the brain actually walks an infinitely thin line, that no other structure could possibly walk.

and so this paradoxical conflict of function, you could say, or to be more specific, in the “howness”, or the way the two hemispheres see the world differently, so to speak, 

is a very striking example of our exploration, and how tension is required for .

### Civilization & Predictability:

If we think about it,

Civilization, at the most fundamental level, 
is the process of gradually making the future <b>less</b> fatally unpredictable,

since all we want as humans is something like the <b>ability</b> to invest our time, energy, & relationships into the future 
(and implicitly the present, of course), 

with more <b>collective</b> predictability of not getting killed by a tiger, 
or not getting in a fatal conflict with another human/state,

(which is really what civilizations are trying to aim towards, most fundamentally, with differences on how to implement that).

But also, if you think about it (which is where the paradox lies),

Civilization is the process of making the future <b>more</b> creatively & excitingly <b>unpredictable</b>, more or less, by definition.

Because how else would we avoid the so called, “tigers”, without the creative, <b>fundamentally unpredictable</b>, nature of the applications of human ideas?

So how do we reconcile the fact that we want the future to be predictable enough to avoid things that get us killed, or even more broadly, avoid things that move us away from the ability to invest in the future,

but for the future to be that way (i.e. predictable enough), 
in a sense, 

we need it to be <b>unpredictable</b> enough to bring up new creative applications & ideas that elevate us.

You could say those domains of predictability are different, 
but they’re really not.

Because if something or some civilizational phenomena is unpredictable (i.e. human’s creative applications of idea), 
it means it could be fatal, more or less by definition, which means that could (only could) bring us back to square one of fatal unpredictability.

And this paradox leads me to what I call the meta-civilization problem.

how do we walk that thin line so easily?
is still an open question.

Which makes the world & how humans conduct civilizations, sooo much more interesting & more complex to think about.

Now caveat; 
this “problem” might not be practically applicable in today’s age, but the problem is just unbelievably interesting to think about philosophically.

### Gravity is the limit & horizon:

So let’s take this one apart as a last example, to strike the nail in the coffin, so to speak

We know that the “resistance” of gravity keeps us down here, on earth. 

And as a consequence of the previous statement, gravity is also one thing that really makes the problem of reaching “space” relatively difficult and requiring resources like rockets, and other things.

But that gravity, despite being the resistance to reaching the “skies”, is also the thing that makes reaching the skies even possible. 

You need the resistance of gravity to hold you back, if you want to “reach” any destination, be it the skies, or anywhere else, 

or to throw some human baggage on it, 
to bare any exploration of the skies.

So even though gravity is the limitation for reaching the “skies” or space, it’s also the thing that actually makes it possible, in a deep sense.

Which further shows us the unbelievably complex, interesting, & perhaps paradoxical nature of the world we live in.

### Conclusion:

So what can we get out of this? 

There might be an important & practical meta point we can extract from all of this, and apply it practically & generally to life:

As we saw in our examples of the brain and the rest of the examples,

#### <b>endless</b> flourishing requires <b>constraints</b>: 
This is a paradigm shifting worldview for so many reasons.

and one of those practical reasons is because the focus will now not be: 
“how do I remove the constraints, to become the best endlessly improving version?”

which is a route many people tend to mistakenly take on certain domains like:
“creativity” (ex: “creativity is unbounded” which is incorrect, in my opinion, because if it’s unbounded it becomes everything including non-creativity)
or 
“identity” (ex: “You can identify however you want”) 
or 
“societal constraints” (ex: “All Societal pressure is bad”)
or
“happiness” (ex: “do whatever makes you happy at the moment”), 

because they think removing the limit/tension/ constraint, will allow more flourishing or “novelty” in character or objective (whatever that includes),

but this is exactly like saying removing the “left-hemisphere” of the brain will allow us to see the world better, 

but as we saw, that “tunnel-vision” of the left hemisphere, is something that’s required and necessary, despite it’s “limitations” on the right hemisphere.

And this is really the problem with many ideas that try to “free” the individual from all constraints, tensions or limitations, 
like for instance, the idea that “you can identify yourself however you want”, 

but what this is actually saying is:
“you’re way less likely to change who you are to the better”, 

because tension is needed for change of character, in this example (which obviously every human on earth needs constantly, more or less).


So the question now becomes: “how do I find the right constraints that will allow the best flourishing, to the degree that that’s possible?”

And that could also apply psychologically, intellectually, and in any other domain of life.
