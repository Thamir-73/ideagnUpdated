This question keeps knocking at the door of reality in some sense, because in one way we perceive the world as a set of problems. It might seem like an obvious question, you have problems and solutions, 

you untangle these two, and there you go you have the answer. But in order to get to the bottom of this question, we need to dig deeper to understand how these two concepts (problems/solutions) relate to reality. 
You would think of some problems as an objective measure in all aspects (since we try to solve a lot of them together as humans, whether in science, companies, projects, or personal endeavours), but if we strip problems out, 
they include assumptions inside them,

and those assumptions in turn are predicated on perceptions of human beings mostly (you can kind of think of these perceptions/assumptions as axioms, 
if we are speaking mathematically).

Now, having cleared out what problems are in some sense, we can look at this question and answer it from two angles that touch each other in some sense. The first is: we as humans will, practically, keep “making up” problems because it’s a function of our perception, 

and our perception changes with the environment and the things we create, and the cycle will run ad infinitum as long as we perceive the world in a continuously dynamic way, So from a practical perspective we say problems will run infinitely (in the loose sense of the term). So that’s from a practical perspective.<br><br>Another way we can approach the question is to try to answer the question in principle, essentially, without the details of practicality. 
It might seem like it’s clear that the human mind is able to answer to any problem in principle, 

but in my opinion, this is far from being conclusive (not wrong just early to make conclusions on). The issue with this approach is that it doesn’t account for the fact that solutions themselves generate problems by way of causality, and also solutions themselves might be looked at as problems given some time. This is because the spectrum of our perception is innumerable in the things it perceives, 
and is subject to change given information, and by way of that fact, we can’t make a conclusive answer to this latter question.

In some sense, our question today is meaningless to start with because we don’t seem to understand what’s the line that separates problems from solutions. It might be clear in using tools like mathematics, but in the real world, the line is blurred in some sense.

But to conclude, one practical approach to life is to assume that every problem (meaning everything we perceive as a problem) at hand can be approached in one way that eventually will lead to a solution (whatever practical thing we mean by that word). It’s an assumption in science and every other human endeavour that is extremely useful to the way we approach the world.
